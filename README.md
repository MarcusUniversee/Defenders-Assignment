# Defenders-Assignment

## How to setup the project on your local machine

### 1. To "clone" or work on this respository onto your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MarcusUniversee/Defenders-Assignment.git
```

### 2. Go into a CLI (Command Prompt or Terminal), and navigate into defenders-assignment folder

Hint: use cd (you should see something like Defenders-Assignment/defenders-assignment)

### 3. Install dependencies with the following command:
```bash
npm i
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the packages listed in package.json/package-lock.json. This includes React!

### 4. Start a web server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command should give you a localhost link to see the web app!

This "dev" command will automatically refresh the website whenever changes are made.


To end the server, use CTRL+C (windows) or CMND+C (mac) to terminate, and type Y.
